## My process to update

### Updating the source code with Semantic HTML Elements
* Example < div class="header" > was changed to < section class="header"> in order to give information on the content inside
  
### Updating without changing the structure
* When changing the div tags in the html, I also changed the corresponding tags in the css
  * .header div { was changed to .header section {

### Icons and Images
* For each image tag, I added an ALT and explanation of the corresponding image
  *  < img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Image of Dollar signs with cog">

### Header tag order
* For this I assured the tags fell in sequential order
  * h1 h2 h3...

### Title description
* Initially the title was "Website" this was changed to "Horiseon About Page"
